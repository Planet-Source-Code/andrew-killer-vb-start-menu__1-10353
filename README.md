### Description

A VB Start Menu that actually looks a little like the the windows one (check screen shot) I downloaded Itay Sagui 's code the other day and i thought it needed some updating (no offence Itay) i kept some of his code in there but its now more like a task bar with my own 'Run' form in as well, it's fully commented nearly everything is explained.

Please check it out, Leave comments & Vote.

(no laughing at my PSC logo hehe)
